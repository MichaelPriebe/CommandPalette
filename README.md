Command Palette gives you everything at your fingertips with a single search. Use `CTRL+SHIFT+P` to bring up the Command Palette and search for what you are looking for. Use `UP` + `DOWN` arrow keys to adjust your selection, and click `ENTER` to execute, or simply click on the option with your mouse.

- Set Titles
- And more!

## ü´• Missing Something?

If you are finding something missing from Command Palette:

### Players üßç

Make a [New Issue](https://github.com/MichaelPriebe/CommandPalette/issues) with your requested action.

---

### Localizers üåê

See [Localization.esMX.lua](CommandPalette/localization/Localization.esMX.lua) for example.

---

### Addon Developers üßë‚Äçüíª

Consider making Bindings for your addons features. Command Palette adds all game and addon bindings to the interface. This helps your users regardless of them using Command Palette.

Binding icons are automatically set to your addons `IconTexture` if your addon name matches the header or category text. Per-binding icons can be set with a global variable:

```lua
-- Any first argument to TextureBase:SetTexture
BINDING_ICON_RAIDTARGET1 = 137001
```

If there is a dynamic action that cannot be put into bindings, you can respond to the `CommandPalette.UpdateActions` event, and add your action. Example: [Titles.lua](CommandPalette/plugins/Titles.lua)

If your action is not addon specific, consider creating a [Pull Request](https://github.com/MichaelPriebe/CommandPalette/pulls) with a new [plugin](CommandPalette/plugins) instead of creating a new addon.

### Blizzard ‚ùÑÔ∏è
- [ ] Create more Bindings for game functions.
- [ ] Create a `binding` type for `SecureActionButtonTemplate`
- [ ] Create `nearbyX` unit types. Nameplates are too limiting.
- [ ] Bring back `[target=Name]` or `[@Name]` macro conditionals.
- [ ] Make functions that take UnitID/UnitToken also take a name.
